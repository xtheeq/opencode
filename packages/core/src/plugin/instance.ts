/**
 * Holds the plugins one instance is born with. Unlike the host-global
 * `SdkPlugins` store, this list is a birth argument of a single instance:
 * `Instance.layer` binds it through the replacement mechanism, so two
 * instances in one process can carry different plugins. The list is immutable
 * for the instance's lifetime; runtime dynamism lives inside plugins through
 * the container transform/reload APIs.
 *
 * Limitations: `vcs` marker declarations in an instance list are not seen by
 * `ProjectMarkers` (it is global and runs during project resolution, before
 * the instance exists — unlike `SdkPlugins`, whose declarations it consumes
 * directly), and config plugin operations may disable instance plugins by id,
 * matching `SdkPlugins` behavior.
