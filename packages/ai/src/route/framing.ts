/**
 * Decode a streaming HTTP response body into provider-protocol frames.
 *
 * `Framing` is the byte-stream-shaped seam between transport and protocol:
 *
 * - SSE (`Framing.sse`) — UTF-8 decode the body, run the SSE channel decoder,
 *   and emit the `data:` payload of each non-empty event. The default drops
 *   `[DONE]`; protocols that use it as a terminal select `sseWithDone`.
 * - AWS event stream — length-prefixed binary frames with CRC checksums.
 *   Each emitted frame is one parsed binary event record.
 *
 * The frame type is opaque to this layer; the protocol's event schema decodes
 * each frame before its state machine handles it.
